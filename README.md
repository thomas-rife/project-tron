User Manual:
In order to run the game you should be able to just run the menu.py file. Menu.py brings up the start screen. From the start screen the user has several choices. They can press start, which uses the normal speed, and the game will start. Or they could select slow or fast, which starts the game with different speeds. Then rounds will be played until one user reaches three, the winner will be displayed and then the menu screen will come back up. To exit the program simply click the close (x) on the top of the screen, which will cleanly exit the program.
