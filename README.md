User Manual:
In order to run the game you should be able to just run the menu.py file. Menu.py brings up the start screen. From the start screen the user has several choices. They can press start, which uses the normal speed, and the game will start. Or they could select slow or fast (difficulty speeds), which starts the game with different speeds. A countdown timer from 3 starts before the game begins to allow the players to get ready. Then rounds will be played until one user reaches three, the winner will be displayed and then the menu screen will come back up. To exit the program simply click the close (x) on the top of the screen, which will cleanly exit the program. This is a two player game. Player one uses the arrows to control one snake, while player two uses wsad to control the other snake. Sometimes when trying to run the program I get a error: "WASAPI can't initialize audio client". This is due to the sound settings I have on my computer, so if I go into settings on my computer and change the speakers it will then work.
